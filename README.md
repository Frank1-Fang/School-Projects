## Projects Overview

### 1. Machine Learning Project  
**Repeat Buyer Prediction for E-Commerce**

This project aims to predict repeat buyers on Tmall using a rich feature engineering pipeline based on user behavior, merchant metrics, and user-merchant interactions. Multiple machine learning models—Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and XGBoost—were evaluated. XGBoost achieved the highest AUC score, though Logistic Regression provided faster convergence and interpretability. Feature importance analysis revealed that merchant-related features and interaction metrics are the most predictive, while demographic data like age and gender had minimal impact.  
**Keywords**: Feature Engineering, XGBoost, Customer Retention, AUC, Tmall

### 2. Numerical Optimization Project  
**Quadratic Programming: Algorithms and Applications**

This project explores the theory, algorithms, and applications of Quadratic Programming (QP), a cornerstone of constrained optimization. We implemented and compared several mainstream QP solvers, including active-set (qpOASES), interior-point (HPIPM), and ADMM-based (OSQP) methods. Further, we proposed improvements for handling non-convex and infeasible cases. Extensive experiments evaluated the sensitivity of solvers (IRWA and ADAL) to parameter variations, tolerances, and problem sizes.  
**Keywords**: QP, IRWA, ADAL, Optimization Theory, Convexity

### 3. Data Visualization Project  
**Visualizing Career Development Insights through Patent Data**

This interactive visualization system analyzes global patent datasets to uncover insights into research investments, institutional behavior, and inventor mobility. Using D3.js and PCA-based clustering, the system enables users to:
- Explore patent output trends over time
- Cluster institutions by R&D patterns
- Analyze gender ratios and team structures
- Visualize talent flows between companies
- Assess the impact of inventor movement on research quality

The system also provides career planning support based on patent class alignment and institutional working styles.  
**Keywords**: D3.js, PCA, K-Means, Talent Flow, Innovation Analytics
